# Employee-Management-System

This application is a management system for the employees of a company and it is designed for only one type of user: the manager. 
It enables the storage and updating of employee data, supporting various managerial operations such as salary adjustments and other modifications.

The graphical interface is made using SFML, a user-friendly multimedia library [https://www.sfml-dev.org/], and is composed of several menus, each serving its own purpose. 

The Main Menu is displayed when the application starts, featuring buttons that guide the user to the other menus. This page consists of the following options:
- Add new employee
- Search for an employee
- Update employee data
- Delete employee
- List all employees

Adding a new employee can be done easily in the next window, as the user has to only fill out the corresponding fields: name, adress, ID number, salary and position.

The Search Menu allows the user to find an employee by specific attributes and displays all employees matching the entered criteria. It also serves as an intermediate step for other operations like updating or deleting employee records.
